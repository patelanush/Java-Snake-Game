# Java-Snake-Game


## A Java-based Snake game featuring classic gameplay with a growing snake and increasing difficulty as players navigate through the screen while avoiding collisions.

The Java Snake game is a classic implementation where players control a snake navigating a grid to eat apples, with the goal of growing the snake and achieving a high score. The game features dynamic movement, collision detection, and scoring, all rendered in a graphical window using Swing. Players use arrow keys to steer the snake, and the game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen borders. The game panel handles drawing, movement, and game logic, including apple generation and score tracking, creating an engaging and interactive experience.
